Latency should be treated as a first class citizen when considering adding features.
Always think in tradeoffs.

1. Latency
2. Quality
3. Capacity

Case Study: Google search
Improved UI nicer to use but affects latency (more assets loaded).
So any UI improvements has to be reviewed with latency always in mind.
Rather than adding features and later dreading the latency that comes with it.

Improving any one, can affect the other:
ex. Increase quality (better UI) can mean more JS and so more latency.

Always be iterating. Trying to find the best solution isn't worth it.
There will be some unknowns and iterate accordingly (revert if a failure).

**Spiral of success:**
- Solve the solution to a problem.
- Get rewarded with new project more challenging project (exciting) but a smaller team
- So *always be scaling* your work


Important vs Urgent (not the same)

**Take Vacations**
The weekend is not enough.
It takes 3 days to forget about your work and that's assuming you don't check slack or email (which breaks the recharge &).
**Psychological Distancing**

**Take real weekends too**
Disconnect

**Take breaks (brain operators in 90min cycles)**

**Take mental health days**
