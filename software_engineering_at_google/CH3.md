# CH3

Linting & enforcing readability (via Changelists = CLs) is a great way to scale best practices.

Documentation that is close to the code and can have feedback linked to (like in google docs when in suggestion mode) is the best - Googles custom vc provide this). 

There needs to be a direct and easy way to update docs otherwise readers won't do it and the problem persists for the next newcommer. 

**Psychological Safety**
- You should feel comfortable asking questions, being wrong & learning new things
- Promotes a learning environment
- Ex. No feigned surprises "What? I can't believe you don't know X?"
- No one should feel like their questions are silly
- Leaders improve the quality of the people around them -> improve the team's PS -> create a culture of teamwork & collaboration.
