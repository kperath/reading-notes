# CH2

Don't hide your code/projects/hobbies ("Learn in public" as I've heard it called)
- helps catch mistakes and you can get feedback before you head down the wrong path (ie. time consuming path - the risk that comes with working alone)

Genius Myth
- Very few pieces of software are built by one man. Sure linus created the initial kernel but the collaboration is what allowed Linux to become what it is.
- Same can be said for Python with Guido and so on.
- Anything that's made a global impact will require collaboration (fundemental to engineering)
- You need partners / team matest

Bus Factor
- How many members of your team need to get hit by a bus before your team is doomed

Lose the ego
- But don't be a doormat - have self-confidence!
- Collective ego can be good - having pride in your team and staying strong to the values
- Give criticism nicely (consider others' insecurities which results in them hiding)

**Get feedback early, fail fast & iterate!**

Be open to influence
- Those that are open to influence can influence others
- Sounds backwards but having an open mind helps! Builds social capital!
- It's OK for someone to change your mind (ie. lose the ego)

Post-Mortem
- Don't put in useless apologies, or excuses or fingerpointing
- Focus why it happened and how we can prevent it from happening again

Googliness (A well defined engineering mindset)
